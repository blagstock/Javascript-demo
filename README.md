# Javascript-demo
An example of a javascript application using the p5 framework (see www.p5js.org & www.thecodingtrain.com)

Just a first example using the framework to produce an updating arc (which can be paused with a mouse pressed) and the ability to alter the background colour by using the R, G and B keys to alter the red, green and blue components respectively (pressing the SHIFT decrease the value).
