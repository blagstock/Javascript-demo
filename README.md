# Javascript-demo

An example of a javascript application using the p5.js  framework (see www.p5js.org & www.thecodingtrain.com).

Just a very basic example using the p5.js framework to produce an updating arc (which can be paused with a mouse press) and background which can be altered by using the R, G and B keys to increase the red, green and blue components respectively (simultaneously pressing the SHIFT key decreases the value).
